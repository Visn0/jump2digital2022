## Background

The Paris Agreement is an international treaty on climate change that was adopted by 196 Parties at COP21 in Paris. Their goal is to limit global warming below 2, preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.

In order to reach the goal, countries are trying to maximize their greenhouse gas emissions and archive a climate-neutral planet.

That is why EU is investing in the development of new technologies that allow the improvement of the fight againts pollution. One of these is a new type of sensor based on laser technology that allows measure of air quality.

## Problem

The goal of the challenge is to develop and implement and predictive model based on *RandomForest* algorithms that allows to know the air quality using measurements of the sensors.

To perform this task, we are provided with a training dataset, a dataset to predict, and an example of the expected format.
